Comment Summarization System for a Social Media Post

1.	Introduction 
Social media and streams, such as Twitter, Facebook or YouTube, contain user comments that depict valuable user opinions. Comments vary greatly in quality and, detecting high quality comments is a subtask of opinion mining and summarization research. On initial viewing these comments may seem less than useful, full of replication, extreme views, petty arguments and spam, but when studied closely and analyzed effectively they provide multiple view points and a wide range of experience and knowledge from many different sources. If we can find ways to analyze the information correctly, we can exploit this crowd-sourced information aggregation so as to automatically produce a summary that is both indicative of the discussion and brief. This allows users to interact with the data at a higher level as it gives an overview impression of the conversation that has occurred.
For any particular informative web resource, it is challenging to quickly ascertain the overall themes and thrusts of the mass of user-contributed comments. While some users may be interested in scanning over hundreds or thousands of comments, there has been a shift in recent years towards providing guidance to users to focus their attention on particular comments. A survey paper by (Potthast et al. 2012) suggests that the most important tasks with regard to understanding the information available in comments are filtering, ranking and summarizing the comments. Several approaches exist for selectively focusing attention, such as editorial selection, collaborative recommendation, keyword cloud. While these and related methods provide a first-step toward making sense of the large amount of user-contributed comments in social media, the overall goal of this project is to develop the algorithms and methods necessary for filtering out non-relevant, non-informative content and presenting a diversified summary of the relevant content to the users, and ensure the continued growth of the social web by enhancing how users engage with short text in social media.

2.	Related Work
There has been considerable prior research on summarization, identifying and ranking relevant content and diversifying the ranking results. Summarization approaches could be categorized into two main kinds: abstractive and extractive. Abstractive summary generates new content from the available input text, while the extractive summary is based on picking the segments of the input text that is more representative of the entire text without any changes to the input. Although abstractive methods would be a desirable way of summarization in general, in the context of comment summarization, extractive summary is more appropriate as it can be supported with evidence in the form of the actual user statement. 
Our proposed algorithm is categorized as non-aspect-based, extractive summarization method. Among related work in the context of extractive summarization, machine learning algorithms such as support vector machines (SVM) and regression models have been used to rank the sentences by degree of preference in social communities. However, Wu et al. concluded that the combination of graph-based algorithms with length shows better result than SVM regression method. Many of the proposed algorithms are based on graph-based ranking, selecting the top-K sentences as the summaries of the input document(s). Examples include TextRank, MEAD, and LexRank.
